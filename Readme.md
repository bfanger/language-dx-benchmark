# Bob's language DX performance benchmark

## The task:

Convert a json string into a data structure, add two values (1 and 2) from that data structure and print the result (3).

## The twist

This is a trivial task for any language, but instead of measuring how many times per second it can do that operation, this benchmark measures the compile and execute performance.

## Why

Being able to see the result of a code change _fast_ is a great developer experience (DX).
